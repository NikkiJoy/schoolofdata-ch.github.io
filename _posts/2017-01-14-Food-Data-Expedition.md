*Food. Data. There is something visceral about those two words placed in combination. Topics that involve absolutely everybody at a very personal level, when fused together lead to a very tasty proposition. Data is behind every bite we eat. But is it wholesome?* This morning data surely helped you off to a healthy start, ensuring that product expiry on the milk, bread and eggs was clearly labelled and accurate within safety limits. This afternoon it will stock the stores of shops and restaurants, providing life support for the nation. If we hardly understand Nutrition Labels, let alone the complex global web of food production, how can we make healthy choices for ourselves or our planet?

We are starting the new year with a *Data Expedition*, a workshop that can help you become more "Adventurous, Benign and Correlational" when it comes to understanding the world of Food - and get up to speed for more data challenges in 2017 as we did in [past expeditions](http://discourse.soda.camp/t/data-expedition-in-bern-may-5-6-2016/84). We will collect datasets, conquer their schema, and defeat the barriers that stand in the way to understanding and further use. Working in teams, our goal will be to stretch our skills and open data for the upcoming **[Open Food Hackdays](http://food.opendata.ch)**.

This Data Expedition will be facilitated by @oleg and @heidi
