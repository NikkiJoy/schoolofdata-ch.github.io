The [School of Data Handbook](https://schoolofdata.org/handbook/) advises us that "all [data] processing can be expressed as a set of incremental stages." Work in each of these *stages* is facilitated by a variety of tools and methods, and every "data wrangler" will have their own favorites, furnished by experience, expertise, the day's technology fashions, or personal preference. While Information Technology moves at a rapid pace - software tools being quickly replaced as the industry moves on - the fundamental steps and techniques relevant to Data Literacy remain universal. 

With this in mind, we started an online toolbox based on the School of Data [pipeline](http://toolbox.schoolofdata.ch/overview.html) in a project to support a school class in Switzerland working on [Open Government Data](https://ogd.tg.ch/) challenges. Our goal is to help beginners get started with a basic overview, demo and pointers to further resources - and keep track of mature, widely adopted open source data wrangling tools.
