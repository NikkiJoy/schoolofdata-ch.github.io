Our next full-day event in Bern is about data DISCOVERY, ANALYSIS & PERSUASION. We will introduce the principles by which the [School of Data](http://schoolofdata.org/) has helped thousands of people around the world to become **data literate**: to not only be able to base decisions based on charts and factoids, but to discover a multitude of ways to "dig in" beyond the surface level.

Join us as we learn to better explore information sources - to make our own analyses - to check the facts and to communicate findings effectively - to wake up to a vivid world of open data. At this hands-on workshop we will:

- 09:00 start with *TAMING DATA DRAGONS*, brief introductions, and sharing of core concepts and principles
- 09:30 jump into *FINDING RELEVANCE* for exploring my world, my neighbourhood, my self in data
- 10:30 learn to *VISUALIZE OPEN DATA* using free tools, and break the "Chart" button spell 
- 12:00 take a *BROWN BAG LUNCH BREAK* for story sharing, networking and nutrition
- 13:00 freshen up with *STATISTICAL ANALYSIS 101* a brief primer in causation, correlation and fact-checking
- 14:00 go hands on with *BUILD-YOUR-OWN-DATA PROJECTS* and get individualised help in your chosen area
- 16:30 get *FURTHER DIRECTIONS* for deeper learning and connect to online communities of practice
- 17:00 wrap up with a small ap√©ro offered by Schoolofdata.ch

We want to involve people with all kinds of skills at this event, whether you are a nutritionist, a data expert or just someone who likes to learn how to work with data. We will be working in groups and learn from each other.

This Data Expedition will be facilitated by [@Oleg](https://forum.schoolofdata.ch/users/oleg/), [@Peter]() and [@Florin]()
