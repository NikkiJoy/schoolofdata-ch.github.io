> Our next full-day event in Bern is about data **DISCOVERY, ANALYSIS & PERSUASION**. We will introduce the principles by which the [School of Data](http://schoolofdata.org/) has helped thousands of people around the world to become *data literate*: to go beyond making decisions from charts and factoids, to discover and delight in a multitude of ways to "dig in" beyond the surface level.

Join us to explore information sources, check facts with our own meta-analysis, and communicate findings effectively - to wake up to a vivid world of open data. At this hands-on workshop we will:

- 09:30 jump into **FINDING RELEVANCE** for exploring my world, my neighbourhood, my self in data
- 10:30 learn to **VISUALIZE OPEN DATA** using free tools, and break the "Chart" button spell
- 12:00 take a **BROWN BAG LUNCH BREAK** for story sharing, networking and nutrition
- 13:00 freshen up with **STATISTICAL ANALYSIS 101** a brief primer in causation, correlation and fact-checking
- 14:00 go hands on with **BUILD-YOUR-OWN-DATA PROJECTS** and get individualised help in your chosen area
- 16:30 get **FURTHER DIRECTIONS** for deeper learning and connect to online communities of practice
- 17:00 wrap up with [anniversary^2](https://blog.soda.camp/001/) ap√©ro offered by our hosts

Our goal is to involve people with **all skill levels** at this event, whether you are a beginning student or seasoned professional, an information discovery guru, or just someone who likes to learn how to work with data for the first time. We will be working in groups and continue learning from each other. Registered and confirmed participants will be invited to network and colloquy[*](#follow) with fellow participants and coaches.
