Learn to work with open data and help to prepare resources for the upcoming [Open Food Hackdays](http://food.opendata.ch). Register for the workshop at [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.de/e/food-data-prep-expedition-tickets-48829204465):

**[FREE REGISTRATION](https://www.eventbrite.de/e/food-data-prep-expedition-tickets-48829204465)**

We wish to involve people with all kinds of skills at this event, whether you are a data connaisseur or just a beginner. Registration is *not* required if you just want to help with this Expedition, but please register at [food.opendata.ch](http://food.opendata.ch) if you wish to _also_ participate in the Hackdays.

## Get started

In the [#Expedition](https://team.opendata.ch/food/channels/expedition) channel of our virtual community (**[sign up here](https://team.opendata.ch/signup_user_complete/?id=d5sor7paep8gtxtbah94yozjea)** to our Mattermost open chat server), as well as through the [discussion forum](https://forum.schoolofdata.ch/t/7-9-9-open-food-data-x-smart-kitchen-hackdays/422), we will be sharing updates on our progress. With these three steps, you too can take part:

### <a href="http://openfood.schoolofdata.ch" class="button special">1. Visit Datacentral &nbsp;<i style="color:#ed0" class="fa fa-lemon-o fa-5" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>

<img align="right" style="margin-left:1em; border:1px solid grey" title="Screenshot of Datacentral" src="/images/posts/food-dc.jpg" width="320">
At [openfood.schoolofdata.ch](http://openfood.schoolofdata.ch) ("Datacentral") and [github/foodopendata](https://github.com/foodopendata) you can see the list of datasets already prepared in the form of Data Packages, each in a GitHub repository. Look around to understand what is meant by *Open Food Data*.

Think about some questions you would like to ask, issues you care about. Run some additional searches on [data portals](http://opendata.swiss) or [search engines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_search_engines). If you have an idea, or find something interesting, hold onto it for the next step.

### <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/J5nHDCBvu3VGmonE3" class="button special">2. Make a suggestion &nbsp;<i style="color:#5e5" class="fa fa-lightbulb-o fa-5" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>

<img align="right" style="margin-left:1em" title="Angelica by Sylvia Fredriksson" src="/images/camps/Angelica_sm_attributed.jpg" width="320">
Ideas you share [in this form](https://goo.gl/forms/J5nHDCBvu3VGmonE3) will go into a [master list](https://github.com/schoolofdata-ch/food-datasets/blob/master/data/food-datasets.csv). This is a public process and requires some moderation.

In particular, we are looking for sources of data which are relatively up to date, with potential for new applications, and which are as free as possible of restrictions and accessibility issues - in the ideal case, open according to the [Open Definition](http://opendefinition.org/). From the best data we discover together, we aim to create as many Data Packages as possible. You can also share your tips by chat or e-mail.

### <a href="http://openfood.schoolofdata.ch/about/" class="button special">3. Package the Data &nbsp;<i style="color:#ff6943" class="fa fa-cutlery fa-5" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>

<img align="right" style="margin-left:1em" title="Open Food Data logo" src="https://food.opendata.ch/wp-content/themes/food.opendata.ch/images/logo.png">
From the [master list](https://github.com/schoolofdata-ch/food-datasets/blob/master/data/food-datasets.csv) we will download and test datasets, do some minor clean-up if necessary, check the [licenses](http://licenses.opendefinition.org/), [create](http://datapackagist.openknowledge.io/) and [validate](https://http://goodtables.io) a Data Package, and document any issues in a README. Data Packages currently being created or updated that we are [looking for help](https://github.com/foodopendata/food-datasets/issues) with are listed in GitHub:
<iframe src="https://azu.github.io/github-issue-widget/?owner=foodopendata&repo=food-datasets&limit=5&random" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="0" width="100%" height="180"></iframe>

If there is a dataset you wish to see supported at [github/foodopendata](https://github.com/foodopendata), you can also fork our [boilerplate](https://github.com/schoolofdata-ch/datapackage-boilerplate) and start a Data Package yourself. If you publish it online, send us the URL for feedback and inclusion in the [master list](https://github.com/schoolofdata-ch/food-datasets/blob/master/data/food-datasets.csv) and [Datacentral](http://openfood.schoolofdata.ch).

You may find our data wrangling [Toolbox](http://toolbox.schoolofdata.ch) and information on [Data Packages](http://openfood.schoolofdata.ch/about/) useful. By this time you may have other things to share or ask, so [let's chat](#register). Then come to the Hackdays and make something amazing!
