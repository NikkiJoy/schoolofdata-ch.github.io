Start the new year with a virtual [Data Expedition](http://schoolofdata.org/data-expeditions/), building up on our [workshops last year](/2017/01/14/Food-Data-Expedition.html). Learn to work with open data and help to prepare resources for the upcoming [Open Food Hackdays](http://food.opendata.ch). We wish to involve people with all kinds of skills at this event, whether you are a data connaisseur or just a beginner. Registration is *not* required if you just want to help with this Expedition, but please see registration instructions at [food.opendata.ch](http://food.opendata.ch) to participate in the Hackdays.

## Let's get started!

In the [#Expedition](https://enguete.schoolofdata.ch/food/channels/expedition) channel of our virtual community ([Sign up here](https://enguete.schoolofdata.ch/signup_user_complete/?id=d5sor7paep8gtxtbah94yozjea) to our open chat server), as well as through the [discussion forum](https://forum.schoolofdata.ch/t/9-1-food-data-expedition/325/1), we will be sharing updates on our progress. With these three steps, you can take part in the Data Expedition:

### <a href="http://openfood.schoolofdata.ch" class="button special">1. Visit Datacentral &nbsp;<i style="color:#ed0" class="fa fa-lemon-o fa-5" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>

<img align="right" style="margin-left:1em; border:1px solid grey" title="Screenshot of Datacentral" src="/images/posts/food-dc.jpg" width="320">
At [openfood.schoolofdata.ch](http://openfood.schoolofdata.ch) (Datacentral) you can see the list of datasets already prepared in the form of Data Packages. Look around to understand what mean by "Open Food Data". Run searches on [data portals](http://opendata.swiss) or [search engines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_search_engines). If you have an idea, or find something interesting, please share it:

### <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/J5nHDCBvu3VGmonE3" class="button special">2. Make a suggestion &nbsp;<i style="color:#5e5" class="fa fa-lightbulb-o fa-5" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>

<img align="right" style="margin-left:1em" title="Angelica by Sylvia Fredriksson" src="/images/camps/Angelica_sm_attributed.jpg" width="320">
Ideas you share [in this form](https://goo.gl/forms/J5nHDCBvu3VGmonE3) will go into a master list. This is a public process and requires some moderation. In particular, we are looking for sources of data which are relatively up to date, with potential for new applications, and which are as free as possible of restrictions and accessibility issues. From the best data we discover together, we aim to create as many Data Packages as possible:

### <a href="http://openfood.schoolofdata.ch/about/" class="button special">3. Package the Data &nbsp;<i style="color:#ff6943" class="fa fa-cutlery fa-5" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>

<img align="right" style="margin-left:1em" title="Open Food Data logo" src="https://food.opendata.ch/wp-content/themes/food.opendata.ch/images/logo.png">
From the [master list](https://github.com/schoolofdata-ch/food-datasets/blob/master/data/food-datasets.csv) we will download and test datasets, do some minor clean-up if necessary, check the [licenses](http://licenses.opendefinition.org/), [create](http://datapackagist.openknowledge.io/) and [validate](https://http://goodtables.io) a Data Package, and document any issues you find in a README.

Data Packages currently being created or updated that we are looking for help with:

<iframe src="https://azu.github.io/github-issue-widget/?owner=foodopendata&repo=food-datasets&limit=5&random" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="0" width="100%"></iframe>

If you do not see a Data Package listed already at [github/foodopendata](https://github.com/foodopendata) for a dataset you wish to see supported, then fork our [boilerplate](https://github.com/schoolofdata-ch/datapackage-boilerplate) and start one yourself. If you publish a Data Package online, send us the URL for feedback and inclusion in [Datacentral](http://openfood.schoolofdata.ch).

You may find our data wrangling [Toolbox](http://toolbox.schoolofdata.ch) and information on [Data Packages](http://openfood.schoolofdata.ch/about/) useful. By this time you may have other things to share or ask, so [let's chat](#register). Then come to the Hackdays and make something amazing!
