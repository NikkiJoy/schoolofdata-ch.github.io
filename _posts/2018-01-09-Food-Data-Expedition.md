*Food. Data. There is something visceral and personal about the two topics in combination. Data is behind every bite we eat - but is it wholesome?* We are starting the new year with a virtual **[Data Expedition](http://schoolofdata.org/data-expeditions/)** building up on the expeditions that [took place last year](https://schoolofdata-ch.github.io/2017/01/14/Food-Data-Expedition.html). Our goals are to learn about working with food data and to prepare open
data for the upcoming [Open Food Hackdays](http://food.opendata.ch).

We want to involve
people with all kinds of skills at this event, whether you are a nutritionist,
a data expert or just someone who likes to learn how to work with (food) data.
We will be working together online and learn from each other.
**Note:** please see registration instructions on the main website to participate in the Hackdays. Registration is, however, *not* required if you just want to help with the Expedition.

## Let's get started!

Here are three easy steps to take part and contribute to the Data Expedition.

<a href="http://openfood.schoolofdata.ch" class="button special">1. Bookmark Datacentral</a>

On our [Datacentral website](http://openfood.schoolofdata.ch), you can see the list of open datasets currently available. Take a look at what we mean by this, and bookmark this page for reference as our goal will be to update this once we get started. Hopefully, you will have some ideas, perhaps run a few searches on [data portals](http://opendata.swiss) or the [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_search_engines), and then ...

<a href="https://goo.gl/forms/J5nHDCBvu3VGmonE3" class="button special">2. Make a suggestion!</a>

From these we pick [promising datasets](https://github.com/schoolofdata-ch/food-datasets/blob/master/data/food-datasets.csv) and work on creating [Data Packages](http://openfood.schoolofdata.ch/about/). Some examples of these can be found in our [GitHub profile](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Adatapackage+org%3Aschoolofdata-ch&type=Repositories). You may find our data wrangling [Toolbox](https://toolbox.schoolofdata.ch) useful if you would like to take part in this process. And you may well by this time have some other things that you'd like to share. This is a good time to:
