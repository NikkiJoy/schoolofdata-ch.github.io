Our next **[Data Expedition](http://schoolofdata.org/data-expeditions/)** focuses on life and data in the neighbourhood. Examining the exact area of 1001 by 1001 metres (1002001 m²) surrounding the [Museum of Digital Arts](http://muda.co/) (MuDA), we would like to question and bring to life the data of what it means to live and work in this district. Through data literacy workshops, talks and events at MuDA, we hope to empower participation by the public in our community embracing the power of information.

We aim to:

- brainstorm what information helps us __be more aware__ of each other in a local community
- find __existing open data__ covering and leading the way to this type of information
- learn how to __make use of data__ with visualisation and fact-checking in everyday life
- clean, prepare and share __new datasets__, openly instructing others in their use

Schedule:

- **Launch +++** Wednesday, March 1, 5 – 8 pm
- Thursday ++ Friday, 5 – 8:30 pm
- Saturday + 12 – 7 pm + **Open Data Day**
- Sunday, March 5 ++ 12 – 7 pm

> In parallel to our workshops, on Saturday, March 4, the *Zurich R User Group* is [hosting a hackathon](http://zurich-r-user-group.github.io/hackathon.html) on occasion of international **[Open Data Day](http://opendataday.org/)**. They will focus on reusing public transport data from [VBZ](https://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/vbz/en/index.html) across various themes. We will present the intermediary results of this workshop there, and help their projects gain more awareness.
